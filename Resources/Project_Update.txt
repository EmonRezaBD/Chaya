Dear Students,

Tomorrow there will be a project update. This is the second project update that will carry minimum 40% marks from your total database project. Update time is strictly maintained. Those groups fail to show update they will get 0 out of 40%. Each group member will be evaluated separately.

We will check the following points on the next update:
1. All Table of your project with constraints
2. Some functionalities using subquery

Group distributions:
• Monday : odd groups
• Wednesday : even groups

Notes:
*** It is a software project. So please show your project update whatever you have completed.
*** As update 1 for most of the groups are not good so you need to give extra care on update-2.
*** As like earlier during class period we will call upon individuals to share his/ her screen.
*** We will not repeat update-2 further. So if anyone get 0 that will be counted as 0 as usual.

Stay home & stay safe.
